# Control Theory at University College Dublin (EEEN 40010)
This class, taken at University College Dublin in the fall of 2024, discusses several techniques (root locus, bode plots) to design various controllers, such as PID, lead/lag, and linear state feedback controllers. Design constraints such as settling time and percent overshoot are heavily considered, and digital controllers are also discussed.

NOTE: The MATLAB code used in each report is included at the bottom of the pdf.
